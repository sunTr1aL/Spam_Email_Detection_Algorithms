# CS409 Final Project - RoBERTa Part

### Spam E-mail Detection Based on RoBERTa
- Using the pre-trained RoBERTa model
- Include three datasets: Enron, Spam Assassin, and TREC 2007
- Dividing the training and testing sets according to the time axis
- Calculating the acc, prec, recall, and F1 values, as well as drawing the confusion matrix


### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:yueqiangwu/CS409_final_project.git`
2. Activate Python virtual environment
2. Install Python packages `transformers`, `torch`, `sklearn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`
3. Change configurations in `config.py` if needed
4. Run `python3 run.py`
5. Results are stored in **OUTPUT_DIR** folder in `config.py`


### Running Details
The program uses pre-processed data **spam_assassin_clean.csv**, **enron_clean.csv**, **trec2007_clean.csv**
 generated by `baselines.py`.
Make sure they are contained in the **DATA_DIR** folder in `config.py`.
